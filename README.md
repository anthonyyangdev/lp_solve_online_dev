# lpsolveweb

This project aims to make an accessible linear programming optimization interface.
This app works with a complementary backend server that processes algebraic optimization models and finds the optimal solution, if possible. The Github repository for the server can be found in this [link](https://github.com/ayang4114/lp_solve_server_dev/tree/master).

You can try out the build deployed on Heroku here:
